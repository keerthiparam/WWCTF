GeoGuessr challenge? I opened the file. It was *obviously* a screenshot of Google Maps Street View, thanks to the 2023 watermark and the wide-angle view. 

I started breaking it down:
- A **Y-shaped** intersection
- A **bridge crossing** with vertical railings
- **Vivid graffiti** under the bridge of a woman's face
- A **traffic light**, a **signboard**, and strong **European vibesâ„¢**

Naturally, I Exif'd it.\
Zero metadata. The image was clean.

</div>

### **Next move:** Reverse image search. 

Google Lens AI said **Boulevard Gambetta** and **Avenue des Baumettes** intersection. 

Source? Trust me bro.

Spoiler: It was wrong.

I gave it another shot, this time focusing on the visuals. I ran it through Google Lens once again.

**Jackpot.**\
I found a match. On **Agoda**.

The hotel? Fabron, Nice. We're close.

No Street View on Agoda. So I hit up Google Maps and started scanning Fabron.

Eventually, I found a street that matched the screenshot's vibe.

I dropped the yellow guy onto the map and time-traveled to 2023.
Perfect match. Graffiti, bridge, traffic lights, all of it.

Grabbed the coordinates straight from the URL:
```43.6880866, 7.2366215```

First guess?
```wwf{43.688, 7.237}```\
No.

Second try?
```wwf{43.688, 7.236}```\
Submitted it. Nothing. I thought it failed. Only later did I realize I had solved it.
