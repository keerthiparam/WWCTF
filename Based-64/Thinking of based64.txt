We are given a base64-encoded file that has multiple lines, each with a base64 string that ends with two equal signs (indicating padding). According to the article by Gynvael, in the case of base64 encoding a single byte (which becomes two base64 characters and then padding), the second base64 character carries 2 bits of the original data and 4 bits that are effectively arbitrary (because the original byte only has 8 bits, and the first base64 character uses 6 bits, leaving 2 bits for the next, which then leaves 4 bits unused). Therefore, the last 4 bits of the second character (i.e., the least significant 4 bits of its base64 index) can be used to hide data.
The structure of each line is "XX==", meaning two base64 characters followed by two padding characters. We are to extract the second character of each such token, get its base64 index, and then take the least significant 4 bits of that index.
We have 51 lines (the last line is "Ry4=" which is 3 characters and one padding, so it doesn't fit the "XX==" pattern). Actually, looking at the content:
The last line is "Ry4=" which is 4 characters (including the padding). But note that the pattern for single-byte encoding is two base64 characters and two '='. So we must only consider the lines that have exactly two base64 characters and then two '='.
Counting the lines in the provided content:
The content has 51 lines. The last line is "Ry4=" which is 4 characters. However, note that the pattern in the file is that each line (except the last) has two base64 characters and then two equals. The last line has three base64 characters and one equals? Actually, let me check:
The last line is "Ry4=". This is 4 characters: 'R', 'y', '4', '='. This is a base64 encoding of two bytes (because 4*6=24 bits, and two bytes are 16 bits, so we have 8 unused bits? Actually, base64 encoding: two bytes (16 bits) would require 3 base64 characters (18 bits) and then one padding. So this line is encoding two bytes, not one.
Therefore, we cannot apply the same steganography technique to the last line because the technique described is for one-byte encodings (which become two base64 characters and two padding).
So we will process the first 50 lines (each of the form "XX==") and ignore the last line? Or perhaps the last line is part of the message? The article mentions that the technique is for single-byte encodings.
Let me read the article again: 
"The trick here is that the Base64 encoding of a single byte (which is 8 bits) ends up as two Base64 characters (which is 12 bits) and then two padding equal signs. This means that the second Base64 character only uses 2 bits from the original data and the remaining 4 bits can be arbitrary. Therefore, we can hide 4 bits of arbitrary data in the second character."
So we are only concerned with the lines that are two base64 characters and two equal signs. We have 50 such lines? Let me count:
The file content has 51 lines. The first 50 lines are of the form "XX==" (two base64 characters and two equals). The last line is "Ry4=" which is not of that form.
Therefore, we will process the first 50 lines.
Steps:
1. For each line (from line 1 to 50):
   - The line has two base64 characters and then two '='. We are interested in the second base64 character.
   - Map that character to its index in the base64 alphabet (which is: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /).
   - Extract the least significant 4 bits of that index (i.e., index mod 16).
2. We now have 50 * 4 = 200 bits. But note that we want to form bytes. Since we have 4-bit nibbles, we can combine every two nibbles to form a byte (first nibble is the high 4 bits, second is the low 4 bits). So we will have 25 bytes (because 50 nibbles / 2 = 25 bytes).
3. Convert these 25 bytes to a string. This string should contain the flag.
But wait: the flag format is "wwf{...}", so we expect the first three characters to be 'w','w','f'.
Let me try with the first two lines:
Line 1: "U3==" -> second character is '3'
Base64 index of '3': 
The base64 alphabet: 
A=0, B=1, ... Z=25, a=26, ... z=51, 0=52, 1=53, 2=54, 3=55, 4=56, ... 9=61, +=62, /=63.
So '3' is 55. In binary: 55 is 0b110111. The least significant 4 bits: 0b0111 -> 7.
Line 2: "T3==" -> second character is '3' again -> 55 -> 0b0111 -> 7.
So the first two nibbles: 7 and 7. Combine: (7 << 4) | 7 = 0x77 -> which is the ASCII for 'w'. Good.
Next two lines:
Line 3: "Un==" -> second character is 'n'. 
'n' is in the alphabet: 'a'=26, 'b'=27, ... 'n'= 26 + 13 = 39? 
But let's compute: 
a=26, b=27, c=28, d=29, e=30, f=31, g=32, h=33, i=34, j=35, k=36, l=37, m=38, n=39.
39 in binary: 0b100111 -> least significant 4 bits: 0b0111 -> 7.
Line 4: "Un==" -> same as above -> 7.
Then the next byte: (7 << 4) | 7 = 0x77 -> 'w'. But we already have two 'w's? We are expecting the next to be 'f'? 
But wait, the flag starts with "wwf", so the next should be 'f'. 
But we have two more 7's? Then the next byte would be 0x77 again? That would be another 'w'. That doesn't match.
Alternatively, we might be getting 50 nibbles and then we form a string of 25 bytes. The first byte is 0x77 -> 'w', the second byte is 0x77 -> 'w', the third byte would be from the next two nibbles.
But let's check line 5: "WW==" -> second character is 'W'. 
Base64: 'A'=0, ... 'W'=22. 
22 in binary: 0b010110 -> least significant 4 bits: 0b0110 -> 6.
Line 6: "IG==" -> second character is 'G'. 
'G' is 6 (since A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3, E=4, F=5, G=6). 
6 in binary: 0b000110 -> least significant 4 bits: 0b0110 -> 6.
So the third byte: (6 << 4) | 6 = 0x66 -> 'f'. 
So the first three bytes: 0x77, 0x77, 0x66 -> "wwf". Perfect.
So we are on the right track.
We'll process all 50 lines.
But note: the last line is "Ry4=", which we skip.
Let's write a script to do this:
Steps in code:
1. Define the base64 alphabet: "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/"
2. Read the file content, split by newline, and take the first 50 lines.
3. For each line:
   - The line has two base64 characters and then two '='. We take the second character (index 1).
   - Find its index in the base64 alphabet.
   - Take `index & 0x0F` (which is the same as `index % 16`).
4. We now have a list of 50 nibbles (each an integer between 0 and 15).
5. Group the nibbles into pairs. For each pair (a, b), form a byte: `(a << 4) | b`.
6. Convert the list of bytes to a string (using ASCII encoding) and print.
But note: the article says that the hidden data is in the LSB 4 bits of the second character, which we are doing.
Let me code accordingly.
However, the last line is not processed, so we only take 50 lines.
But wait: the provided content has 51 lines. The last line is "Ry4=". We skip that.
Now, let's do the entire extraction.
We'll do it manually for the first few to verify:
Line 1: "U3==" -> '3' -> index 55 -> 55 & 15 = 7
Line 2: "T3==" -> '3' -> 55 & 15 = 7 -> byte1: (7<<4)|7 = 0x77 -> 'w'
Line 3: "Un==" -> 'n' -> 39 -> 39 & 15 = 7
Line 4: "Un==" -> 'n' -> 39 -> 7 -> byte2: 0x77 -> 'w'
Line 5: "WW==" -> 'W' -> 22 -> 22 & 15 = 6
Line 6: "IG==" -> 'G' -> 6 -> 6 & 15 = 6 -> byte3: (6<<4)|6 = 0x66 -> 'f'
Line 7: "VH==" -> 'H' -> 7 -> 7
Line 8: "SL==" -> 'L' -> 11 -> 11 -> byte4: (7<<4)|11 = 0x7B -> '{'  (which is the opening brace of the flag)
Perfect.
We can continue, but we'll write a program to do it.
But since we are in a text-based environment, we can do it step by step.
We have 50 lines. We need to extract 50 nibbles, then form 25 bytes.
Let me list the second character for each of the 50 lines:
1. '3' -> 55 -> 7
2. '3' -> 55 -> 7
3. 'n' -> 39 -> 7
4. 'n' -> 39 -> 7
5. 'W' -> 22 -> 6
6. 'G' -> 6 -> 6
7. 'H' -> 7 -> 7
8. 'L' -> 11 -> 11
9. 'X' -> 23 -> 7? Wait, line9: "RX==" -> second char is 'X'. 
   'X' is 23 (if A=0, then X is 23) -> 23 & 15 = 7
10. 'l' -> 37? Wait, line10: "Ul==" -> second char is 'l'. 
    'l' is the 37th character? 
    A-Z: 0-25, a-z: 26-51. 'l' is the 12th letter in lowercase: 26+11=37? 
    Actually: a=26, b=27, ..., l=26+11=37 -> 37 mod 16 = 5? 
    But 37 in binary: 0b100101 -> last 4 bits: 0101 = 5.
Wait, I see a discrepancy. Let me check:
Base64 alphabet: 
0: 'A' ... 25: 'Z', 26: 'a', 27: 'b', 28: 'c', 29: 'd', 30: 'e', 31: 'f', 32: 'g', 33: 'h', 34: 'i', 35: 'j', 36: 'k', 37: 'l', 38: 'm', 39: 'n', ... 
So yes, 'l' is 37. 37 % 16 = 5.
But earlier I thought line10 was "Ul==" -> second char is 'l' -> 37 -> 5.
But wait, the line is "Ul==" -> the two characters are 'U' and 'l'. So second character is 'l'. 
So we must recalc.
I did line9: "RX==" -> second char is 'X' -> 23 -> 7.
Line10: "Ul==" -> second char is 'l' -> 37 -> 5.
Line11: "RW==" -> second char is 'W' -> 22 -> 6
Line12: "IO==" -> second char is 'O'? Actually, the line is "IO==" -> so second char is 'O'. 
    'O' is 14 (since A=0, B=1,..., O=14) -> 14
Line13: "SV==" -> second char is 'V' -> 21 -> 5
Line14: "U1==" -> second char is '1' -> 53 (because '0'=52, so '1'=53) -> 53 mod 16 = 5
Line15: "IH==" -> second char is 'H' -> 7 -> 7
Line16: "Tj==" -> second char is 'j' -> 35 (26+9) -> 35 mod 16 = 3
Line17: "Tz==" -> second char is 'z' -> 51 -> 51 mod 16 = 3
Line18: "ID==" -> second char is 'D' -> 3 -> 3
Line19: "Rm==" -> second char is 'm' -> 38 -> 38 mod 16 = 6
Line20: "LE==" -> second char is 'E' -> 4 -> 4
Line21: "QV==" -> second char is 'V' -> 21 -> 5
Line22: "R/" -> wait, the line is "R/==" -> so second char is '/' -> 63 -> 63 mod 16 = 15
Line23: "IG==" -> second char is 'G' -> 6 -> 6
Line24: "VC==" -> second char is 'C' -> 2 -> 2
Line25: "Tz==" -> second char is 'z' -> 51 -> 3
Line26: "IB==" -> second char is 'B' -> 1 -> 1
Line27: "Qn==" -> second char is 'n' -> 39 -> 7
Line28: "RU==" -> second char is 'U' -> 20 -> 4
Line29: "IH==" -> second char is 'H' -> 7 -> 7
Line30: "Rj==" -> second char is 'j' -> 35 -> 3
Line31: "T1==" -> second char is '1' -> 53 -> 5
Line32: "Vf==" -> second char is 'f' -> 31 -> 15
Line33: "Tj==" -> second char is 'j' -> 35 -> 3
Line34: "RD==" -> second char is 'D' -> 3 -> 3
Line35: "IH==" -> second char is 'H' -> 7 -> 7
Line36: "SB==" -> second char is 'B' -> 1 -> 1
Line37: "RX==" -> second char is 'X' -> 23 -> 7
Line38: "Ul==" -> second char is 'l' -> 37 -> 5
Line39: "RT==" -> second char is 'T' -> 19 -> 3
Line40: "Lk==" -> second char is 'k' -> 36+? -> 36 mod 16 = 4
    Actually: 'k' is 36 -> 36 mod 16 = 4
Line41: "IG==" -> second char is 'G' -> 6 -> 6
Line42: "UM==" -> second char is 'M' -> 12 -> 12
Line43: "TH==" -> second char is 'H' -> 7 -> 7
Line44: "Ra==" -> second char is 'a' -> 26 -> 10
Line45: "QV==" -> second char is 'V' -> 21 -> 5
Line46: "U/" -> line is "U/==" -> second char is '/' -> 63 -> 15
Line47: "RX==" -> second char is 'X' -> 23 -> 7
Line48: "ID==" -> second char is 'D' -> 3 -> 3
Line49: "RH==" -> second char is 'H' -> 7 -> 7
Line50: "T0==" -> second char is '0' -> 52 -> 4
Now, we have 50 nibbles:
[7,7,7,7,6,6,7,11,7,5,6,14,5,5,7,3,3,3,6,4,5,15,6,2,3,1,7,4,7,3,5,15,3,3,7,1,7,5,3,4,6,12,7,10,5,15,7,3,7,4]
Now, we group into pairs:
1. (7,7) -> 0x77 -> 'w'
2. (7,7) -> 0x77 -> 'w'
3. (6,6) -> 0x66 -> 'f'
4. (7,11) -> 0x7B -> '{'
5. (7,5) -> 0x75 -> 'u'
6. (6,14) -> 0x6E -> 'n'
7. (5,5) -> 0x55 -> 'U'
8. (7,3) -> 0x73 -> 's'
9. (3,3) -> 0x33 -> '3'
10. (6,4) -> 0x64 -> 'd'
11. (5,15) -> 0x5F -> '_'
12. (6,2) -> 0x62 -> 'b'
13. (3,1) -> 0x31 -> '1'
14. (7,4) -> 0x74 -> 't'
15. (7,3) -> 0x73 -> 's'
16. (5,15) -> 0x5F -> '_'
17. (3,3) -> 0x33 -> '3'
18. (7,1) -> 0x71 -> 'q'
19. (7,5) -> 0x75 -> 'u'
20. (3,4) -> 0x34 -> '4'
21. (6,12) -> 0x6C -> 'l'
22. (7,10) -> 0x7A -> 'z'
23. (5,15) -> 0x5F -> '_'
24. (7,3) -> 0x73 -> 's'
25. (7,4) -> 0x74 -> 't'
So the string is: 
"wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st"
But the flag should end with '}'. We have 25 bytes, so we have 25 characters. The last two are "st", and we are missing the closing brace and maybe more? 
But note: the flag format is wwf{...}, and we have 25 characters. The opening brace is the 4th character, so we have 21 characters inside. The last two are "st", which might be the beginning of "steganography" or something else? But we are missing the closing brace.
Alternatively, we might have made a mistake.
Wait, the last line of the base64 content was "Ry4=" which we skipped. But the challenge description says the flag is in the file. Maybe we are supposed to include the last line? But the last line is two bytes, so it doesn't fit the one-byte pattern.
Alternatively, the article might have a different technique for multi-byte blocks? But the challenge says "base64 has some interesting properties" and the description by Gynvael is about the one-byte case.
Let me check the last line: "Ry4=". This decodes to two bytes. How? 
Base64 decode: 
'R' -> 17, 'y' -> 50, '4' -> 56, and then padding. 
So the 24 bits: 
17: 010001, 50: 110010, 56: 111000 -> but because of padding, we ignore the last 8 bits? Actually, two bytes: 
We take the first 16 bits: 010001 110010 11???? -> but wait, the padding indicates that the last 4 bits of the third character are not used. 
The article also discusses two-byte blocks: 
"Similarly, when encoding two bytes (16 bits) we end up with three Base64 characters (18 bits) and one padding equal sign. This means that the third Base64 character only uses 4 bits from the data and the remaining 2 bits can be arbitrary."
So for the last line (which is two bytes encoded) we can use the two unused bits? But the article says the third character has 2 unused bits. However, the article then uses 4 bits per one-byte block and 2 bits per two-byte block. But we have only one two-byte block at the end.
But we have 50 one-byte blocks and one two-byte block. We already extracted 200 bits from the 50 one-byte blocks. Then the two-byte block at the end: we can extract 2 bits from the third character.
But our current extracted string is 25 bytes (200 bits). We need to see if the flag is exactly 25 bytes or if we need to append the 2 bits? That would not be a whole byte.
Alternatively, the last line might be part of the message without steganography? Or it might be the closing brace.
Looking at the extracted string: "wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st"
We are missing the closing brace. But the last line is "Ry4=" which decodes to what? 
Base64 decode "Ry4=": 
R -> 17, y -> 50, 4 -> 56, then padding. 
17: 010001, 50: 110010, 56: 111000 -> but we only take the first 16 bits? 
The 24-bit group: 010001 110010 111000 -> but since there is one padding, we discard the last 8 bits? Actually, two-byte encoding: 
The 16 bits are: 01000111 00101110 -> 0x47, 0x2E -> which is 'G.' in ASCII? 
But that doesn't help.
Alternatively, we can apply the two-byte steganography to the last line: 
In two-byte encoding, the third character has 2 unused bits. 
The third character is '4', which has base64 index 56. 
We extract the least significant 2 bits of that index: 56 mod 4 = 0? 
But we need two bits: 56 in binary: 0b111000, so the last two bits are 00.
Then we have two more bits: 00.
But we have 200 bits already and two more bits, which is 202 bits. That doesn't form a whole byte.
Alternatively, the last line is not used for steganography and the flag is indeed 25 bytes, and we are missing the closing brace because the flag is not complete? 
But the extracted string ends with "st", which might be the start of "eganography" or "stream", but we don't have enough bytes.
Another possibility: we made an error in the extraction of the nibbles.
Let me double-check the base64 alphabet indexing.
We have a list of the second characters and their indices and the extracted nibble (value mod 16). We did:
Line 1: '3' -> 55 -> 7
Line 2: '3' -> 55 -> 7
Line 3: 'n' -> 39 -> 7
Line 4: 'n' -> 39 -> 7
Line 5: 'W' -> 22 -> 6
Line 6: 'G' -> 6 -> 6
Line 7: 'H' -> 7 -> 7
Line 8: 'L' -> 11 -> 11
Line 9: 'X' -> 23 -> 7
Line 10: 'l' -> 37 -> 5
Line 11: 'W' -> 22 -> 6
Line 12: 'O' -> 14 -> 14
Line 13: 'V' -> 21 -> 5
Line 14: '1' -> 53 -> 5
Line 15: 'H' -> 7 -> 7
Line 16: 'j' -> 35 -> 3
Line 17: 'z' -> 51 -> 3
Line 18: 'D' -> 3 -> 3
Line 19: 'm' -> 38 -> 6
Line 20: 'E' -> 4 -> 4
Line 21: 'V' -> 21 -> 5
Line 22: '/' -> 63 -> 15
Line 23: 'G' -> 6 -> 6
Line 24: 'C' -> 2 -> 2
Line 25: 'z' -> 51 -> 3
Line 26: 'B' -> 1 -> 1
Line 27: 'n' -> 39 -> 7
Line 28: 'U' -> 20 -> 4
Line 29: 'H' -> 7 -> 7
Line 30: 'j' -> 35 -> 3
Line 31: '1' -> 53 -> 5
Line 32: 'f' -> 31 -> 15
Line 33: 'j' -> 35 -> 3
Line 34: 'D' -> 3 -> 3
Line 35: 'H' -> 7 -> 7
Line 36: 'B' -> 1 -> 1
Line 37: 'X' -> 23 -> 7
Line 38: 'l' -> 37 -> 5
Line 39: 'T' -> 19 -> 3
Line 40: 'k' -> 36 -> 4
Line 41: 'G' -> 6 -> 6
Line 42: 'M' -> 12 -> 12
Line 43: 'H' -> 7 -> 7
Line 44: 'a' -> 26 -> 10
Line 45: 'V' -> 21 -> 5
Line 46: '/' -> 63 -> 15
Line 47: 'X' -> 23 -> 7
Line 48: 'D' -> 3 -> 3
Line 49: 'H' -> 7 -> 7
Line 50: '0' -> 52 -> 4
Now, the bytes:
1. (7,7) -> 0x77 -> 'w'
2. (7,7) -> 0x77 -> 'w'
3. (6,6) -> 0x66 -> 'f'
4. (7,11) -> 0x7B -> '{'
5. (7,5) -> 0x75 -> 'u'
6. (6,14) -> 0x6E -> 'n'
7. (5,5) -> 0x55 -> 'U'
8. (7,3) -> 0x73 -> 's'
9. (3,3) -> 0x33 -> '3'
10. (6,4) -> 0x64 -> 'd'
11. (5,15) -> 0x5F -> '_'
12. (6,2) -> 0x62 -> 'b'
13. (3,1) -> 0x31 -> '1'
14. (7,4) -> 0x74 -> 't'
15. (7,3) -> 0x73 -> 's'
16. (5,15) -> 0x5F -> '_'
17. (3,3) -> 0x33 -> '3'
18. (7,1) -> 0x71 -> 'q'
19. (7,5) -> 0x75 -> 'u'
20. (3,4) -> 0x34 -> '4'
21. (6,12) -> 0x6C -> 'l'
22. (7,10) -> 0x7A -> 'z'
23. (5,15) -> 0x5F -> '_'
24. (7,3) -> 0x73 -> 's'
25. (7,4) -> 0x74 -> 't'
So the string is: "wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st"
But we are missing the '}' and perhaps more. However, the flag should be inside the curly braces, and we have 21 characters inside. The last two are "st", which might be part of "step" or "stream", but we don't have enough.
Wait, the last line is "Ry4=". Maybe it is used for the closing brace? But how.
Perhaps the last line is not skipped and we should process it differently.
Another idea: the last line is part of the steganography but for two-byte block. But then we only get 2 extra bits, which is not enough for a character.
Alternatively, the flag is exactly "wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st}" and we are to include the last line as the closing brace? But that doesn't work.
Perhaps we are supposed to use the last line to extract two bits and then somehow append to the bit stream. But 202 bits is 25 bytes and 2 bits, which is not byte-aligned.
 unless the flag does not require the closing brace and is exactly 25 bytes? But then it should be a valid string.
But "wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st" is not a complete flag.
Another possibility: the last line "Ry4=" is not used for steganography, but is part of the cover message. When we decode the entire base64 content, what do we get?
Let me decode the entire content:

Concatenating all: 
"SORRY THERE IS NO FLAG, TO BE FOUND HERE. PLEASE DO NOT CONTINUE TOOKINGG."
This is the cover text.
But the steganography extraction gave us "wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st", which is 25 characters.
Perhaps the flag is "wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st}" and the last two letters "st" are the beginning of "steganography" and we are to assume the rest? But that doesn't make sense.
Alternatively, we may have a off-by-one in the nibble grouping.
Another possibility: the last two nibbles (7 and 4) form 't' (0x74), and then we are done. But the flag is incomplete.
Perhaps the last line "Ry4=" is used to extract the closing brace. But how.
Let me try to extract the two unused bits from the last line as described in the article for two-byte blocks.
For the last line: "Ry4=", the third character is '4', which has index 56. The article says to take the least significant 2 bits of this index. 
56 in binary: 0b111000 -> last two bits are '00'.
So we have two more bits: 00.
Now, we have 202 bits. The last two bits are 00, which are not enough for a character.
 unless we consider that the flag is exactly as extracted and the last two letters "st" are part of the flag, and the flag is "wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st}".
But then we are missing the '}'.
Perhaps the last line is not used, and the flag is 25 bytes, and we should include the '}' in the extraction? But we don't have it.
Another idea: the flag is "wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_steganography}" but we only have 25 bytes.
We have 25 bytes: "wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st" -> 25 characters.
The inside should be: "unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st" -> 21 characters.
But the flag might be "wwf{unused_bits_equals_steganography}" but we have "unUs3d", not "unused", and "3qu4lz", not "equals", and then "st".
So it's leet: "unused" -> "unUs3d", "equals" -> "3qu4lz", and then "st" for "steganography" but only "st" is extracted.
Given the constraints, we only have 25 bytes, so the flag might be "wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st}".
But how do we get the '}'? We don't have it in the extraction.
Unless the last two bits from the last line are used to form part of the '}'? But '}' is ASCII 125, which is 0x7D, or in binary 01111101. We have two bits 00, which doesn't match.
Perhaps the last line is not used, and the flag is "wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st}" and the '}' is implied? But that doesn't make sense.
Another possibility: we are to use the entire bit stream including the two bits from the last line, and then interpret the bit stream as ASCII, and the last two bits might be part of a byte that is not complete, but we can ignore them if they are padding.
But 202 bits is not a multiple of 8, so we would have to have 2 padding bits, which we have as 00.
But then the last byte would be from the last 8 bits of the 200 bits plus the two bits? The last 8 bits of the 200 are the last byte we have: 0x74 't'. The next two bits 00 would make the next byte start with 00, but we only have two bits.
Alternatively, we form the last byte as the last 6 nibbles? No.
I think the intended flag is "wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_steganography}" but we don't have enough data.
Perhaps we missed that the last line can be processed for two bits, and then we have to wait for more data, but there isn't any.
Let me count the number of lines again. The provided content has 71 lines. But the first 50 are of the form "XX=="? No, the provided content is 71 lines? Let me count the lines in the file content given.

So there are 71 lines. The first 50 are from index 1 to 50, and then there are 21 more lines.
But the last line (71) is "Ry4=", which is a two-byte encoding. The lines from 51 to 70 are mostly "XX==" (one-byte encoding) except the last line.
Let me check the last few lines:
 line 51: "ID==" -> one-byte
 line 52: "Tj==" -> one-byte
 ...
 line 70: "Tg==" -> one-byte
 line 71: "Ry4=" -> two-byte
So we have 70 lines of one-byte encoding (XX==) and one line of two-byte encoding (XXX=).
For the 70 one-byte encoding lines, we can extract 4 bits each, for a total of 280 bits.
Then for the two-byte encoding line, we can extract 2 bits.
Total bits: 282 bits, which is 35.25 bytes. Not a whole number.
Alternatively, the two-byte encoding line is not used, and we use only the 70 one-byte lines, giving 280 bits = 35 bytes.
Then the flag might be 35 bytes.
Let me try with the first 70 lines.
Extract for each of the 70 lines the second character, its index, and the last 4 bits.
We already have the first 50. We need lines 51 to 70.
Line 51: "ID==" -> second char 'D' -> 3 -> 3
Line 52: "Tj==" -> second char 'j' -> 35 -> 3
Line 53: "T2==" -> second char '2' -> 54 -> 6
Line 54: "VH==" -> second char 'H' -> 7 -> 7
Line 55: "ID==" -> second char 'D' -> 3 -> 3
Line 56: "Qw==" -> second char 'w' -> 48? 'A'=0, 'Z'=25, 'a'=26, 'w' is 26 + 22 = 48 -> 0
Line 57: "T1==" -> second char '1' -> 53 -> 5
Line 58: "Tv==" -> second char 'v' -> 47 -> 15 ( 'v' = 26+21=47)
Line 59: "VG==" -> second char 'G' -> 6 -> 6
Line 60: "SW==" -> second char 'W' -> 22 -> 6
Line 61: "Tn==" -> second char 'n' -> 39 -> 7
Line 62: "VV==" -> second char 'V' -> 21 -> 5
Line 63: "RW==" -> second char 'W' -> 22 -> 6
Line 64: "IO==" -> second char 'O' -> 14 -> 14
Line 65: "TH==" -> second char 'H' -> 7 -> 7
Line 66: "T9==" -> second char '9' -> 61 -> 13 ( '9'=61)
Line 67: "Tw==" -> second char 'w' -> 48 -> 0
Line 68: "Sw==" -> second char 'w' -> 48 -> 0
Line 69: "SI==" -> second char 'I' -> 8 -> 8
Line 70: "Tg==" -> second char 'g' -> 32 -> 0
So now we have 70 nibbles. The first 50 we had, and the next 20:
[3,3,6,7,3,0,5,15,6,6,7,5,6,14,7,13,0,0,8,0]
Now, the entire list of 70 nibbles is:
[7,7,7,7,6,6,7,11,7,5,6,14,5,5,7,3,3,3,6,4,5,15,6,2,3,1,7,4,7,3,5,15,3,3,7,1,7,5,3,4,6,12,7,10,5,15,7,3,7,4,3,3,6,7,3,0,5,15,6,6,7,5,6,14,7,13,0,0,8,0]
Group into 35 bytes by taking two nibbles per byte:
1. (7,7) -> 'w'
2. (7,7) -> 'w'
3. (6,6) -> 'f'
4. (7,11) -> '{'
5. (7,5) -> 'u'
6. (6,14) -> 'n'
7. (5,5) -> 'U'
8. (7,3) -> 's'
9. (3,3) -> '3'
10. (6,4) -> 'd'
11. (5,15) -> '_'
12. (6,2) -> 'b'
13. (3,1) -> '1'
14. (7,4) -> 't'
15. (7,3) -> 's'
16. (5,15) -> '_'
17. (3,3) -> '3'
18. (7,1) -> 'q'
19. (7,5) -> 'u'
20. (3,4) -> '4'
21. (6,12) -> 'l'
22. (7,10) -> 'z'
23. (5,15) -> '_'
24. (7,3) -> 's'
25. (7,4) -> 't'
26. (3,3) -> '3'
27. (6,7) -> 'g'
28. (3,0) -> '0'
29. (5,15) -> '_'
30. (6,6) -> 'f'
31. (7,5) -> 'u'
32. (6,14) -> 'n'
33. (7,13) -> '}'
34. (0,0) -> '\x00'
35. (8,0) -> 'P' (0x80)
This gives "wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st3g0_fun}\x00P" which is not right, because the null byte and 'P' are not part of the flag.
We see that the '}' is at position 33, and then we have two more bytes.
 Perhaps the flag is only the first 33 bytes: "wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st3g0_fun}" 
 But "st3g0_fun" doesn't make sense. We expected "steganography" or something.
 Alternatively, we stop at the '}' and ignore the rest.
 The '}' is at byte 33: from the nibbles 66 and 67: (7,13) -> 0x7D = '}'.
 So the flag might be "wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st3g0_fun}" 
 But let me see what that means: "unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st3g0_fun" -> leet for "unused bits equals st3g0 fun"? 
 "st3g0" might be "stage0", and then "_fun".
 So the flag is "wwf{unused_bits_equals_stage0_fun}" in leet: unUs3d, equals -> 3qu4lz, stage0 -> st3g0.
 So it is "wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st3g0_fun}"
 But in the extraction, after "st" (from position 24 and 25) we have "3g0_fun}".
 So the full flag inside is: "unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st3g0_fun"
 This has 21+9 = 30 characters inside? Let me count: 
 "unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st3g0_fun" -> 
  unUs3d: 6
  _b1ts: 5
  _3qu4lz: 7
  _st3g0_fun: 10 -> total 6+5+7+10 = 28.
 But we have 33-4 = 29 bytes inside? The flag is from byte 5 to byte 33: 
 byte 5: 'u'
 byte 33: '}'
 So the inside is 29 bytes: "unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st3g0_fun"
 Count: 
 u n U s 3 d _ b 1 t s _ 3 q u 4 l z _ s t 3 g 0 _ f u n -> 
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29
 29 characters.
 So the flag is "wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st3g0_fun}"
 But in the extraction, we have two more bytes: (0,0) -> 0x00 and (8,0) -> 0x80, which are not printable and likely not part of the flag.
 So we take the string up to the '}'.
 Therefore, the flag is "wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st3g0_fun}"
 Let me verify with the extraction of the last part of the nibbles:
 From the 50th nibble: 4
 then the next (51 to 70): [3,3,6,7,3,0,5,15,6,6,7,5,6,14,7,13,0,0,8,0]
 So the pairs from 26 to 35:
26. (4,3) -> 0x43 -> 'C' -> but wait, we had at position 25: (7,4) -> 't'
 then pair 26: (3,3) -> 0x33 -> '3'
27. (6,7) -> 0x67 -> 'g'
28. (3,0) -> 0x30 -> '0'
29. (5,15) -> 0x5F -> '_'
30. (6,6) -> 0x66 -> 'f'
31. (7,5) -> 0x75 -> 'u'
32. (6,14) -> 0x6E -> 'n'
33. (7,13) -> 0x7D -> '}'
34. (0,0) -> 0x00 -> '\0'
35. (8,0) -> 0x80 -> non-printable
 So the string from byte 26 onward: '3'+ 'g'+ '0'+ '_'+ 'f'+ 'u'+ 'n'+ '}' 
 So the inside after "st" is "3g0_fun}"
 Therefore, the entire flag string is:
 "wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st3g0_fun}"
 This is 33 bytes: positions 1 to 33.
 So we take the first 33 bytes.
 Therefore, the flag is: wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st3g0_fun}
 Let me write it: 
 wwf{
 unUs3d
 _b1ts_
 3qu4lz_
 st3g0_fun
 }
 So "stage0" -> "st3g0", and then "_fun".
 This seems to make sense.
 So the final answer.
After re-examining the base64-encoded content and applying the steganography technique described in Gynvael's article, the hidden flag is extracted by processing all 71 lines of the file. The first 70 lines are single-byte Base64 encodings (format "XX=="), and the last line ("Ry4=") is a two-byte encoding that is not used for steganography in this context.

Extraction Process:
For each of the 70 single-byte lines:

Extract the second Base64 character (e.g., from "U3==", take '3').

Map the character to its Base64 index (A=0, B=1, ..., /=63).

Take the least significant 4 bits of this index (value range 0-15).

Resulting nibbles (70 values):

text
[7,7,7,7,6,6,7,11,7,5,6,14,5,5,7,3,3,3,6,4,5,15,6,2,3,1,7,4,7,3,5,15,3,3,7,1,7,5,3,4,6,12,7,10,5,15,7,3,7,4,3,3,6,7,3,0,5,15,6,6,7,5,6,14,7,13,0,0,8,0]
Group nibbles into bytes:

Combine every two nibbles into one byte: byte = (first_nibble << 4) | second_nibble.

This produces 35 bytes.

Decoded bytes to ASCII:

The first 33 bytes form the flag, ending with '}' (ASCII 125). Bytes 34 and 35 are non-printable (null and 0x80) and discarded.

Extracted Flag String:
text
wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st3g0_fun}
Explanation:
The technique leverages the "unused" least significant 4 bits in the second character of single-byte Base64 encodings to hide data.

The flag uses leet substitutions:

unUs3d = "unused"

3qu4lz = "equals"

st3g0 = "stage0"

The full message reads as "wwf{unused_bits_equals_stage0_fun}".

Final Flag:
wwf{unUs3d_b1ts_3qu4lz_st3g0_fun}
